# Sierpinski triangle
## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle

This project roughly created the Sierpinski triangle, using turtle in Python.

At startup, a triangle with base 1000 pixels is drawn and a first random dot is drawn inside this triangle.
After this, a random corner is chosen and the distance between the dot and this corner is calculated.

Then, a dot is placed halfway between these two points.

After this happened, a new random corner is chosen and a dot is drawn halfway between these two points.
This process repeats until the program is closed manually.
